## 2.0.0

The major goals of this rewrite were to add new or missing features and to improve consistency and efficiency. A lot of changes were made to Discordia to achieve these goals; many of them are breaking. Please read the following changelog carefully and update your applications accordingly.

**Note:** Due to changes made by Discord, versions of Discordia prior to 2.0.0 may not be supported on or after October 16, 2017.

### General Changes

#### Connectivity
- Bot tokens must now be manually prefixed with `Bot `
- The core of the library that establishes and maintains a connection to Discord has been overhauled (see Internal Changes for more information)
- More and clearer information regarding the client's connection is now logged
- Manual sharding is now supported
- Updated to Discord gateway v6
- Updated to Discord REST API v7
- Guilds are no longer automatically synced by default (user accounts only)

#### Dependencies
- Updated coro-http from 2.1.1 to 3.0.0
- Updated coro-websocket from 1.0.0 to 3.1.0
- Updated secure-socket from 1.1.4 to 1.2.0
- Removed coro-fs

#### Class Behavior
- Class methods are no longer automatically generated for class properties (eg: `User:getUsername` is not a valid alternative for `User.username`)
	- Properties are generally used for items that are immediately available for consumption
	- Methods are generally used for items that require arguments or an HTTP or WebSocket request to be procured
	- Some previously generated methods may still exist (eg: `TextChannel:getFirstMessage` exists; `TextChannel.firstMessage` does not exist)
	- Some previous property-method pairs may still exist (eg: `Role.color` exists and is a number; `Role:getColor` exists and returns a `Color` object)
	- Properties are never directly mutable; all mutations are done via methods
- `class` module is no longer automatically registered as a global (access the new `class` field of the `discordia` module instead)
- Added various helper functions: `isClass`, `isObject`, `isSubclass`, `isInstance`, `type`, `profile`
- Calling `class` now returns only a class and getter table (instead of a class table and property, method, and cache constructors)
- Changed the "private" `class.__classes` table to `class.classes`

#### Caches and Iterables
- Properties and methods that access caches have been removed and replaced by caches that can be directly accessed
- Some shortcut methods remain (eg: `client:getGuild` and `channel:getMessage`)
- Stand-alone iterators for cached objects have been changed to iterable objects (eg: `message.mentionedUsers` is now an `ArrayIterable`)
- Stand-alone iterators for HTTP-accessible objects have been removed and replaced by methods that return an iterable object (eg: `channel.invites` was replaced by `channel:getInvites`)
- Iterable objects are those that implement the `Iterable` mixin; all have an `iter` method plus methods that rely on this
- The `Iterable` mixin provides methods such as `get`, `find`, `forEach`, etc
- Classes that implement the `Iterable` mixin are:
	- `Cache` - for main Discord objects (eg: guilds, channels, roles)
	- `SecondaryCache` - for select references to objects that are cached elsewhere (eg: pinned messages)
	- `ArrayIterable` - for objects that are better represented in an ordered form, and sometimes mapped (eg: member roles, mentioned users)
	- `WeakCache` - for objects that are either never directly deleted or are temporarily referenced from other locations (eg: channel messages)

#### New Container Classes
- `Ban` - represents a guild ban (provides a user object and reason)
- `GroupChannel` - represents a group DM channel (user accounts only)
- `Relationship` - represents friends and blocked users (user accounts only)

#### New Utility Classes
- `Date` - used to represent a single instance in time
- `Time` - used to represent a specific length of time
- `Logger` - used to log messages to the console and files

#### Error Messages and Logging
- New `Logger` class added
	- Available log-levels are `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`, and `none`
	- Messages use a format `timestamp | level | message`
	- Messages are logged to the console and to a file
- The client uses a `Logger` instance with a default level of `info`, default file of `discordia.log`, and default timestamp of `%F %T`
- Shards use the main client logger, but prefix messages with `Shard: #` where `#` is the shard ID.
- Most methods that return false or nil to indicate a failure will now return an error message as their second return value
	- This generally applies to methods that make HTTP requests
	- When available, more detailed error messages will be provided than those that are sent to the client logger; always check these messages when debugging issues

#### Input resolution
- Added `Resolver` singleton (used internally)
- Methods that previously required certain objects now accept object hashes or objects that can be similarly hashed (eg: `member:addRole` now accepts either a `Role` object or snowflake ID)
- Methods that previously required raw base64 now also accept a path to a file

#### Enumerations
- Added `enums` module to the main `discordia` module
- Most types and levels are now enumerated as Lua numbers
- Enumerated properties can be more easily represented using fields within the `enums` module (eg: `channelType.voice` and `verificationLevel.medium`)

#### Extensions
- Module is no longer automatically loaded into the global Lua modules (call the modules to load them instead)
- Removed `printf` function
- Combined `string.split` and `string.split2` into one `string.split`
- Combined `string.padleft`, `string.padright`, and `string.padcenter` into one `string.pad`

## 1.5.0
- Implemented webhook features
	- Added `Webhook` class
	- Added `Guild.webhooks` and `GuildTextChannel.webhooks` iterators  (both use an HTTP request)
	- Added `GuildTextChannel:createWebhook` method
- Text channel and message improvements
	- `bulkDelete` and `getMessageHistory` improvements
		- Added optional predicates to filter specific messages
		- `After|Before|Around` methods now optionally accept a Snowflake ID instead of a `Message` object
	- Added `firstMessage` and `lastMessage` properties to `TextChannel` (both use an HTTP request)
	- Added support for raw data file attachments
	- Added support for multiple file attachments per message
- Added `User.privatechannel` property (uses an HTTP request)
- `Guild:createRole` now accepts an initial `name` argument
- Replaced `TYPING_START` warnings with `typingStartUncached` event
- Disabled member object creation on `PRESENCE_UPDATE`
	- Fixes lingering member objects after guild leave
	- Fixes missing `joinedAt` property
	- May provide a performance improvement
	- To compensate for missing members, enable `fetchMembers` on client initialization
- Other changes
	- Fixed voice sequence and timestamp incrementing
	- Fixed `Emitter` listener addition/removal
	- Fixed crash on guild creation due to rogue member presences
	- Changed `os.exit` in `client:stop` to `process:exit`
	- Changed `print` call in console logging function to `process.stdout:write`


## 1.4.2
- Fixed bug in Guild:setOwner
- Fixed nickname not being cleared from member objects
- Minor optimization in `printf`


## 1.4.1
- Added token check to socket reconnection
- Fixed bug when setting client nickname via Member
- Added default JSON table for non-JSON HTTP responses
- Added checks for invalid client options
- Restored fixed creationix/coro dependency versions
- Extensions added:
	- `string.random` for generating random string
	- `string.split2` for splitting strings by pattern [@FiniteReality]


## 1.4.0
- Implemented automatic gateway sharding
	- Multiple shards are automatically spawned on startup according to the Discord-recommended amount
	- Added a `shardReady` event that fires as each shard finishes loading with a shard ID as its argument
	- Shard ID is also now an argument for the `resumed` and `heartbeat` events
	- `Client.shardCount` and `Guild.shardId` are accessible properties
- Overhauled token parsing and login handling:
	- Tokens can now optionally be prefixed with `Bot `
	- Tokens are validated before establishing a gateway connection; invalid tokens are rejected with an error
	- Attempts to connect or reconnect to the gateway are no longer pcall'd
	- To simplify `READY` handling, failed loading of guild chunk or sync payloads will result in `ready` never firing instead of timing out
	- Added support for compressed gateway payloads (enabled by default)
	- Replaced `gateway.cache` with `gateway.json`
- Member conveniences:
	- Added `User.mutualGuilds` iterator
	- Added `Member.color` property
	- Added `Member:hasRole` and `Member:hasRoles` methods
	- Added `Member:addRole` and `Member:removeRole` methods

	- Removed member check from `PRESENCE_UPDATE` handler
	- Fixed functions not explicitly returning `nil` in some cases
	- Added default audio library names which can allow for automatic loading of libopus.so and libsodium.so on POSIX systems or opus.dll and sodium.dll on Windows. (Call `loadOpus` or `loadSodium` without arguments to use the defaults)
	- Fixed a missing parameter in the sodium decrypt function (not currently used by Discordia)


## 1.3.1
- Event handler optimizations
	- If an uncached guild, channel, member, or role is encountered on their respective `UPDATE` or `DELETE` events, an object is now created and cached from the event payload instead of throwing a warning.
	- Events that parse a text channel ID are now more performant; the channel is found by using an channel map instead of by iterating over guilds.
- Token parsing on login was improved
	- Tokens are no longer prepended with `Bot ` on `READY`. Tokens are tested against a REST endpoint (`/users/@me`), and are prepended with `Bot ` only if necessary.
	- If an invalid token is provided, the library will throw an error instead of entering a connect/disconnect loop.
- Opus encoder fix
	- The encode method now expects an explicitly defined PCM length instead of one implicitly defined from the input table.
	- This should fix a segmentation fault issue which apparently was a result of passing a size that is too small.
	- Fixed an oversight where the positional return value of `string.unpack` was passed to the opus encoder for FFmpeg streams.


## 1.3.0
- Message enhancements
	- Deprecated `TextChannel:sendMessage(content, mentions, tts)` format
	- `TextChannel:sendMessage(content)` is now the suggested format, where `content` is a string or table. Table properties are:
		- `content`: raw content string
	- `mentions`: mentionable object or table of mentionable objects
	- `tts`: boolean indicating whether the message is TTS
	- `nonce`: unique message identifier
	- `file`: relative or absolute path to file for attachment
	- `filename`: custom name to use for attachment (not required)
	- `embed`: table of message embed data
	- File attachments made possible by multipart/form-data implementation [@PurgePJ]
	- Added `nonce` and `oldContent` properties to `Message` class
	- Added `attachments`, `embeds`, `attachment`, and `embed` properties to `Message` class. All are exposed as raw Lua tables with original Discord formatting.

## 1.0.0

- General

	- All mentions of *server* or *Server* were changed to *guild* or *Guild* to maintain consistency with internal Discord nomenclature
	- Methods that use the REST API and that previously returned nothing now return a boolean to indicate whether the call was successful
	- Discord-compliant ratelimiting has been implemented
	- User handling has been changed slightly:
		- `User` objects are now cached once per `Client` instead of per every `PrivateChannel` and `Guild`
		- The `Member` class now wraps the `User` class instead of extending it
		- To get a user's `Member` object, use `User:getMembership(guild)`
		- A member's `User` object is accessed via `Member.user`
		- Message authors, channel recipients, and invite inviters are always `User` objects
		- Guild owners and members are always `Member` objects
	- `utils` was removed from the main `discordia` module and has been replaced by individual utility classes
	- `Warning` and `Error` classes were removed in favor of events
		- Gateway disconnects, nil values on events, and HTTP errors are now handled more gracefully
	- All modules relevant to the `Client` class were refactored and moved with it into a `client` folder:
		- `Client` now extends a custom version of Luvit's built-in `Emitter`
			- Client instances are initialized using `discordia.Client()` instead of `discordia.Client:new()`
			- A table of options can be passed to the client initializer. Currently supported options are:
				- `routeDelay`: minimum time to wait between requests per-route (default: 300 ms)
				- `globalDelay`: minimum time to wait between requests globally after a global 429 (default: 10 ms)
				- `messageLimit`: limit to the number of cached messages per channel (default: 100)
				- `largeThreshold`: limit to how many members are initially fetched per-guild on start-up (default: 100)
				- `fetchMembers`: whether to fetch all members for all guilds (default: false)
				- `autoReconnect`: whether to attempt to reconnect after an unexpected gateway disconnection (default: true)
		- `endpoints` was changed to `API`
		- `events` was changed to `EventHandler`
		- `WebSocket` was changed to `Socket`
	- Discord objects are now stored in custom `Cache` objects instead of pure Lua tables
	- Many iterators were added to help with accessing cached objects or methods that used to return a table
	- The entire class system was overhauled
		- Internally used properties and methods are now prefixed with an underscore to indicate their protected status
		- Getter and setter properties and methods have been added.
			- For every public property that can be accessed/mutated, there is an associated get/set method
			```lua
			-- these lines examples are equivalent
			local name = guild.name
			local name = guild:getName()
			```
			```lua
			-- these lines examples are equivalent
			guild.name = "foo"
			guild:setName("foo")
			```
		- Objects that have caches have a variety of get and find methods for accessing those caches. For example:
			- `guild:getRoles()` or `guild.roles` - returns an iterator for all roles in the guild
			- `guild:getRoleCount()` or `guild.roleCount` - returns the number of roles cached
			- `guild:getRole(id)` - returns the role with the given Snowflake ID
			- `guild:getRole(key, value)` - returns the first found role matching a key, value pair
			- `guild:getRoles(key, value)` - returns an iterator for all roles matching the key, value pair
			- `guild:findRole(predicate)` - returns the first found role that makes the predicate true
			- `guild:findRoles(predicate)` - returns an iterator for all roles that makes the predicate true
			```lua
			-- pre-1.0 code
			for _, role in pairs(guild.roles) do
					print(role)
			end
			```
			```lua
			-- 1.0 code
			for role in guild.roles do
				print(role)
			end

			for role in guild:getRoles() do
				print(role)
			end
			```


- Events

	- Event handling was made more reliable by using the new `Cache` objects
	- Attempts to access uncached objects are now caught, and warnings are printed to the console
	- Guild sync was implemented for non-bot accounts
	- `serverCreate` was renamed/split into `guildCreate`, `guildAvailable`, and `guildCreateUnavailable`
	- `serverDelete` was renamed/split into `guildDelete` and `guildUnavailable`
	- `messageAcknowledge` and `membersChunk` were removed
	- `memberBan` and `memberUnban` were renamed to `userBan` and `userUnban` and now provide a `User` object instead of a `Member` object
	- `voiceJoin` and `VoiceLeave` were renamed/split into `VoiceChannel[Join|Leave]` and `voice[Connected|Disconnect]`
	- `typingStart` now has a timestamp as a third argument
	- `messageUpdateUncached` and `messageDeleteUncached` events were added for uncached message events
	- `warning` and `error` events were added
	- `heartbeat` event was added with event sequence and roundtrip latency arguments


- New Classes

	- `API` - Adds a layer of abstraction between Discord's REST API and Discordia's object oriented API
	- `Container` - Base object used to store Discord objects
	- `Cache` - Data structure used to store and access `Container` objects
	- `Emitter` - A simplified re-write of Luvit's built-in event emitter
	- `Mutex` - Extension of `Deque` that is used by the `API` class to throttle HTTP requests
	- `OrderedCache` - Extension of `Cache` that maintains the order of objects as a doubly-linked list
	- `Stopwatch` - Used to measure elapsed time with nanosecond precision
	- `PermissionOverwrite` - Extension of `Snowflake` that maintains per-channel permissions
